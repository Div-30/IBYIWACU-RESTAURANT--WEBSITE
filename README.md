Ibyiwacu Restaurant is a local restaurant offering a variety of culinary delights. To enhance its online presence and showcase its services, I developed this website which is my first website and as part of the One Million Coders program. The site provides an overview of the restaurant's offerings, making it easier for customers to discover and connect with Ibyiwacu.

The website provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the restaurant's menu, finding its exact location, and conveniently placing delivery orders.
